*CIFAR10 Image Classification with Neural Networks and CNN*

This project focuses on the practical application and exploration of neural networks, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets), for image classification tasks using the CIFAR10 dataset. The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Highlight: Implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum manually.

Technolgies Used:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- numpy
